# FactoryFour

**Status page for the FactoryFour APIs.**

In order to visualize what APIs are up or down, we will build a dashboard to allow visualize

the FactoryFour APIs status.

**To consider**

*The code should be easy to read, understand, and change. For example,
a customer success rep might need to change the 15-second interval to
a 10-second interval. Someone with a limited working knowledge of JS
should be able to find that line of code, change it on a branch in GitLab,
and tag you for approval. Choose variable and file names that will help
people grok your code with minimal effort.*
